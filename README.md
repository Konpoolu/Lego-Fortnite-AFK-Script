# Lego-Fortnite-AFK-Script
This is an AHK script that randomly moves your Lego Fortnite character.

**The keybind is Shift+Control+M. This is a toggle!**

Why?
If you leave this script on for 2 hours and 30 minutes, you get 420,000 XP (per day)

How?
This script chooses a direction, and then makes you move in said direction for a set amount of time.

There are two versions of this script:
- Slow, which moves you for 10 seconds ever 9 minutes and 59 seconds.
- Fast, which constantly moves you, and changes directions every 1 second.

Please note that the .AHK scripts require a download of AutoHotKey V1, which can be found here: https://www.autohotkey.com/
The .EXE versions of the files are flagged by Windows Defender. Hit "More Info" and "Run Anyway" to run the script.
